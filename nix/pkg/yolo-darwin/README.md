# yolo-darwin — macOS environment-separated LLM tool launcher

`yolo-darwin` is the macOS equivalent of the Linux `yolo` bubblewrap sandbox. It provides per-profile isolation of Claude Code, Codex, and pi configurations, settings, plugins, and credentials on a single macOS user account, using the Seatbelt (sandbox-exec) sandbox instead of bubblewrap.

## Quick start

Launch an isolated Claude Code session from a project directory (not your home directory):

```bash
yolo claude
```

With a named profile (e.g., "work"):

```bash
yolo --profile work claude
```

Or using the `--work` alias:

```bash
yolo --work claude
```

## Subcommands

All subcommands are confined and profile-isolated. Choose the agent and any arguments:

- `yolo claude [args...]` — Launch Claude Code with optional arguments passed to `claude` (e.g., `yolo claude --settings <file>`).
- `yolo codex [args...]` — Launch Codex with optional arguments (e.g., `yolo codex --search`).
- `yolo pi [args...]` — Launch pi, the Anthropic coding agent (e.g., `yolo pi chat`).
- `yolo shell [args...]` — Start an interactive shell confined within the sandbox, with the active profile's environment variables.
- `yolo cmd <program> [args...]` — Execute an arbitrary program confined within the sandbox (e.g., `yolo cmd git status`).

All agents inherit the active profile's configuration directories (when set).

## Flags and profiles

### Profile selection

Profiles isolate each agent's configuration, credentials, and session history under `~/.config/yolo/<name>/<agent>`. The default (no profile) uses the agents' real home directories (`~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, `~/.pi`).

- `--profile NAME` or `-p NAME` — Select a named profile. The profile name must contain only letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `-`, and cannot be `.` or `..`. Each agent (claude, codex, pi) gets a private directory under `~/.config/yolo/<name>/`.
- `--work` or `-w` — Shorthand for `--profile work`. Useful for launching a "work" profile with minimal typing.

Example:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/yolo/personal ~/.config/yolo/work  # optional; created automatically
yolo --profile personal claude
yolo --work codex --search
```

### Feature suppression and activation

- `--disable=TAG` — Exclude prompt fragments and pre-start hooks carrying `TAG`. Repeatable and comma-separated, matching Linux `yolo` parsing.
- `--enable=TAG` — Turn on a feature that is off by default. Repeatable and comma-separated, matching Linux `yolo` parsing; `--disable=TAG` wins over `--enable=TAG` for the same tag. No Darwin feature is opt-in yet (Linux has `display` for Wayland passthrough).

```bash
yolo --disable=gpu,ssh --disable=github claude
```

### Working directory safety

By default, `yolo-darwin` refuses to launch from your home directory (`$HOME`) because the sandbox grants read-write access to `$PWD`. Launching from `$HOME` would expose every credential, key, and shell history in your home directory, defeating profile isolation.

- `--unsafe-share-home` — Opt out of the `$PWD == $HOME` refusal. Use this flag only if you understand the security implications and want to operate from your home directory. Equivalent to `cd` into a subdirectory first and running without the flag.

### Environment variables

Pass arbitrary environment variables into the confined agent:

- `--env KEY=VAL` — Set an environment variable `KEY` to `VAL` inside the sandbox. Repeatable. The `KEY` must be a valid POSIX environment-variable name (starting with a letter or underscore, followed by letters, digits, or underscores). These variables are applied **only** to the agent's exec environment, not to the launcher's own environment or command-line arguments.

Example:

```bash
yolo --env RUST_BACKTRACE=1 --env DEBUG=true claude
```

### Ad-hoc filesystem grants

- `--ro PATH` — Grant read-only access to an existing host path.
- `--rw PATH` — Grant read-write access to an existing host path.

Both flags are repeatable, preserve the host path inside the sandbox, and skip
missing paths. Symlinks receive grants for both the link and its canonical
target.

## Profile directory layout

When you select a named profile (e.g., `--profile work`), `yolo-darwin` creates and isolates directories for each agent:

```
~/.config/yolo/work/
├── claude/           # CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR when --profile work
│   ├── settings.json
│   ├── .claude.json
│   ├── projects/
│   ├── plugins/
│   └── ...
├── codex/            # CODEX_HOME when --profile work
│   ├── config.toml
│   ├── prompts/
│   ├── skills/
│   ├── auth.json
│   ├── sessions/
│   └── ...
└── pi/               # PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR when --profile work
    ├── settings.json
    ├── APPEND_SYSTEM.md
    ├── cq-agents/
    ├── prompts/
    ├── skills/
    ├── auth.json
    ├── sessions/
    └── ...
```

Each directory is created with `chmod 700` (read-write-execute for the owner only).

All three agents get the home-manager-managed shared assets **copied** into their profile directory before every named-profile launch, regardless of which agent or `shell`/`cmd` mode was selected (claude: settings.json, CLAUDE.md, skills, plugins, commands, agents; codex: AGENTS.md, prompts, skills; pi: settings.json, AGENTS.md, APPEND_SYSTEM.md, cq-agents, prompts, skills, extensions, mcp.json). The copies are dereferenced and self-contained (no symlinks back into the sandbox-denied real homes). Managed assets are source-authoritative: when a profile copy differs, the launcher moves it to the next unused `<asset>.yolobak-N` path and installs the current home-manager source. Identical assets remain untouched and produce no backup.

The default profile (empty, no `--profile` flag) does NOT create any directories. Agents use their real home directories:

- Claude Code reads/writes `~/.claude/` and `~/.claude.json`.
- Codex reads/writes `~/.codex/`.
- pi reads/writes `~/.pi/`.

## Confinement model

`yolo-darwin` uses macOS Seatbelt (sandbox-exec) to confine each agent. For each launch, a per-launch Seatbelt profile (SBPL) is generated and applied via `claude-code-sandbox --use-profile`.

### What is confined

Read-write access is granted only to:

- **The working directory** (`$PWD`) — where you launched `yolo`.
- **`~/.cache`** — cache directory shared across profiles.
- **cq's XDG state root** — `$XDG_STATE_HOME/cq` when `XDG_STATE_HOME` is an absolute path, otherwise `~/.local/state/cq`; required by the ledger MCP server and Claude stop gate.
- **This profile's configuration directories** (when a named profile is active) — only the active profile's `~/.config/yolo/<name>/claude`, `~/.config/yolo/<name>/codex`, `~/.config/yolo/<name>/pi` directories are accessible; sibling profiles are explicitly denied.
- **Declarative and `--rw` paths** — exact paths configured through `extraReadWritePaths` or supplied per invocation.

Read-only access is granted to system files required to run the agent:

- `/usr`, `/bin`, `/opt` (executables and libraries).
- `/nix` (Nix store packages).
- `~/.config/git`, `~/.gitconfig`, `~/.config/jj` (version control configuration).
- `~/.nix-profile`, `~/.config/nix`, `~/.local/share/nix` (Nix configuration).
- `~/.config/gh` (GitHub CLI configuration).
- `~/.config/mcp`, `~/.config/direnv`, `~/.local/share/direnv`, and `~/.direnvrc` (from the pinned upstream base profile).
- Declarative `extraReadOnlyPaths` and per-invocation `--ro` paths.
- A configured Podman/Docker Unix socket, including both a stable symlink and
  its canonical runtime target.
- System configuration: `/etc`, `/var`, `/System`, and essential service files.

### What is NOT confined

- **Network** — All network access is allowed (parity with `claude-code-sandbox noread.sb`). Agents can make API calls without restriction.
- **The rest of your home directory** — Everything outside the working directory and the active profile's directories is denied. In particular, if you use the default profile, agents have read-write access to their real `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, `~/.pi` directories but are denied all other home directories.

### Credential isolation

When using a named profile, the Seatbelt profile implements credential isolation by:

1. Denying access to the entire `~/.config/yolo` tree by default.
2. Re-granting read-write access **only** to the active profile's subdirectories (e.g., `~/.config/yolo/work/claude`, `~/.config/yolo/work/codex`, `~/.config/yolo/work/pi`).

This isolates file-backed credentials and session state. Claude Code's native credentials remain in the user's shared macOS Keychain database; `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` makes Claude Code select a profile-specific Keychain item, but Seatbelt path rules do not isolate individual Keychain items by service name.

## Per-profile authentication setup

Each named profile requires one-time manual setup so that Claude Code, Codex, and pi each authenticate independently.

### Claude Code — native per-profile login

Claude Code scopes its macOS Keychain credential to `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`. Authenticate each named profile directly:

```bash
yolo --profile work claude
```

Run `/login` and complete the browser flow with the intended subscription account. Claude Code stores the credential in a profile-specific Keychain item whose name starts with `Claude Code-credentials-`; subsequent launches with the same profile reuse that credential. The default profile continues to use the unsuffixed `Claude Code-credentials` item.

### Codex — file-based credentials

Codex stores subscription and MCP OAuth credentials. For profile isolation, configure each profile's `config.toml` to use file-based credential storage instead of the shared macOS Keychain:

1. **Create a profile directory and config**:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/yolo/work/codex
   chmod 700 ~/.config/yolo/work/codex
   ```

2. **Create or edit `~/.config/yolo/work/codex/config.toml`** and add the following at the top (before any table headers):

   ```toml
   cli_auth_credentials_store = "file"
   mcp_oauth_credentials_store = "file"
   ```

   This tells Codex to store subscription credentials in `auth.json` and MCP OAuth tokens in files within the profile's directory, not in the shared macOS Keychain.

3. **Launch Codex and authenticate**:

   ```bash
   yolo --profile work codex login
   ```

   Complete the authentication flow. Codex stores the credentials in `~/.config/yolo/work/codex/auth.json` (treat this as a secret file).

4. **Each profile is now independently authenticated**. Subsequent launches use the stored credentials from that profile's `auth.json`.

**Important**: Do not select `keyring` or `auto` for `cli_auth_credentials_store` if you need profile-isolated credentials independent of the shared Keychain. Use `file` explicitly.

### pi — automatic per-profile state isolation

pi (the Anthropic coding agent) exposes a configuration-directory environment variable, `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`. When you use a named profile, `yolo-darwin` automatically:

1. Sets `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` to the profile's pi directory (e.g., `~/.config/yolo/work/pi`).
2. Copies the HM-managed shared assets (settings.json, AGENTS.md, APPEND_SYSTEM.md, cq-agents, prompts, skills, extensions, mcp.json) from your main pi installation (`~/.pi/agent/`) into the profile directory, so it is self-contained (the real `~/.pi` stays denied by the sandbox).

This means:

- Each profile's pi instance has its own `auth.json`, sessions, trust store, and npm packages.
- Shared assets (like skill definitions) are synchronized on every launch. A differing profile copy is preserved as `<asset>.yolobak-N` before the home-manager version replaces it.

To authenticate pi in a named profile:

```bash
yolo --profile work pi login
```

Complete the authentication flow. The credentials are stored in `~/.config/yolo/work/pi/auth.json`, automatically isolated from other profiles.

## Runtime behavior and environment

When an agent runs under `yolo-darwin`:

- **Host variables are cleared** before the sandbox starts. Only process identity, `PATH`, terminal and locale settings, XDG paths, `TMPDIR`, selected Nix runtime variables, and editor/pager preferences are retained as a baseline; other values require explicit configuration or `--env`.
- **Profile environment variables** (e.g., `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `CODEX_HOME`, `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`) are set only for named profiles and applied **before** explicit `--env KEY=VAL` pairs, so an explicit flag overrides a profile default.
- **Declarative session variables** and the extra-package `PATH` come from the home-manager module and apply to every subcommand.
- **Container runtime variables** set `DOCKER_HOST` and `CONTAINER_HOST` when
  the configured Podman socket exists. On macOS with `podman-mac-helper`, the
  stable socket is normally `~/.local/share/containers/podman/machine/podman.sock`.
- **Secret session variables** are read from their configured files into one mode-0600 temporary file, loaded by the child entrypoint without placing secret values in argv, and removed after the session.
- **Host and sandbox pre-start hooks** run for agent modes only; sandbox hooks run after secrets load and can export environment variables to the agent. `--disable` filters both hook sets by tag.
- **CodeGraph project indexes** are initialized or synchronized by the same `codegraph`-tagged sandbox pre-start hook as Linux. The agent starts the MCP server on demand; `--disable=codegraph` skips the index bootstrap for one launch.
- **`--env KEY=VAL` pairs** are applied to the agent process **only**, not to the launcher itself, and not visible in the command-line arguments of the spawned process.

### Remaining platform-specific gaps

**Remaining runtime integration proposal:** keep `extraDevicePaths` as a
Linux-specific interface rather than translating `/dev` and PipeWire paths.
Filesystem-backed devices can use ad-hoc `--ro`/`--rw` grants; audio or devices
that require Mach or IOKit permissions should add a tagged policy fragment only
after live Seatbelt denial probes identify the required operations. tmux needs
no separate adapter while the upstream profile grants the host temporary
directories containing its socket.

**Shell-mode proposal:** add a shell-specific Seatbelt overlay selected from
`$SHELL`: grant only that shell's startup files read-only and redirect writable
history to a private temporary file. Verify zsh, bash, and fish startup and
history behavior on macOS before enabling it; the Linux bind list does not by
itself establish the corresponding Seatbelt operations.

## Manual macOS verification checklist

The `yolo-darwin-profile` flake check covers deterministic SBPL generation,
CLI and declarative path grants, Podman's stable-symlink and runtime-socket
grants, environment/secret/hook propagation through a hand-written sandbox
adapter, profile-wide asset materialization, the per-profile directory layout,
and the `$PWD==$HOME` guard. It also asserts that the pinned upstream base
carries the shared MCP and direnv grants. Live Seatbelt execution must run
outside the Nix Darwin builder because macOS rejects nested `sandbox-exec` with
`sandbox_apply: Operation not permitted`.

Run the steps below on a Mac using an actual test repository. They cover live confinement, account/credential resolution, session isolation, and OAuth refresh. At minimum, confirm `yolo cmd pwd` succeeds from the repository and that `yolo cmd cat <an unrelated home path>` fails without leaking its contents.

For each profile you set up (e.g., "personal" and "work"):

1. **Start from a test repository** — `cd` into a project directory on your Mac (not your home directory).

2. **Launch the first profile and inspect the active account**:

   ```bash
   yolo --profile personal claude /status
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yolo --work codex status
   ```

   Confirm that the account shown matches the subscription or user account you configured for that profile (e.g., "personal@example.com").

3. **Verify session isolation** — after a real session, confirm the live agent state (sessions, logs, credentials) landed only under this profile's `~/.config/yolo/personal/claude/` (or `codex`/`pi`) and does NOT appear in another profile's dir. (The dirs themselves — one per agent, mode `700` — are already asserted by the `yolo-darwin-profile` flake test; this step confirms a real agent actually writes its session there.)

   ```bash
   ls -la ~/.config/yolo/personal/claude/
   ```

4. **Launch the second profile**:

   ```bash
   yolo --profile work claude /status
   ```

   Confirm that this shows a **different** account than the first profile. Verify that its session directory (`~/.config/yolo/work/claude/`) is separate.

5. **Restart both profiles and confirm account retention** — Close both agents and relaunch each profile:

   ```bash
   yolo --profile personal claude /status
   yolo --profile work claude /status
   ```

   Each should still show its original account. If you see the wrong account, check:
   - For Claude Code: Did you run `/login` separately inside each named profile?
   - For Codex: Is the profile's `config.toml` using `cli_auth_credentials_store = "file"`?
   - For pi: Is the `auth.json` in the correct profile directory?

6. **For Claude Code, re-test after OAuth refresh** — If you wait long enough (hours to days), Claude Code may refresh its OAuth token. Restart Claude Code after a refresh and confirm that it still shows the correct account for the profile. This verifies that the native profile-specific credential remains associated with the intended account.

   **Timing note**: Token refresh is automatic and depends on the token's age and usage. You may not observe a refresh during a single session; this step is optional but recommended for long-running environments.

Repeat the live inside/outside-path probe after policy or macOS upgrades; deterministic flake checks cannot substitute for executing Seatbelt on the host.

## Environment variable precedence

When launching `yolo-darwin`, environment variable precedence is:

1. **Allowlisted launcher environment** (process identity, `PATH`, terminal, locale, XDG, `TMPDIR`, selected Nix runtime variables, and editor/pager preferences).
2. **Profile environment variables** (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `CODEX_HOME`, `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`).
3. **Configured Podman/Docker socket variables**.
4. **Extra-package `PATH`**, when packages are configured.
5. **Declarative `sessionVariables`**.
6. **Explicit `--env KEY=VAL` pairs**.
7. **Secret-file-backed variables**.
8. **Environment exported by sandbox pre-start hooks**.

Later entries override earlier entries with the same name. `SMIND_SANDBOXED=1`
is set by the launcher and cannot be overridden through declarative variables or
`--env`.

## Troubleshooting

### "Error: refusing to run yolo-darwin from $HOME"

The launcher detected that your working directory is your home directory. Sandboxing from `$HOME` would expose all your credentials. Solution:

```bash
cd ~/projects/my-project
yolo claude
```

Or, if you truly want to operate from your home directory, explicitly opt out:

```bash
cd ~
yolo --unsafe-share-home claude
```

### Claude Code shows the wrong account after a profile switch

For the default (no-profile) case, Claude Code uses the shared macOS Keychain credential. If you previously logged in with a different account, that credential may persist. Solution:

1. Use a named profile and run `/login` inside it (see "Claude Code — native per-profile login" above).
2. Or, open Claude Code's settings and sign out from `/login`, then sign back in with the desired account.

### Codex login fails or shows the wrong account

Ensure the profile's `config.toml` file exists and includes the file-based credential-store settings:

```bash
cat ~/.config/yolo/work/codex/config.toml
# Should include:
# cli_auth_credentials_store = "file"
# mcp_oauth_credentials_store = "file"
```

If you see `keyring` or another value, edit the file to change these settings, then try logging in again:

```bash
yolo --profile work codex login
```

### pi complains about missing configuration or sessions

Verify that the profile directory and shared assets are in place:

```bash
ls -la ~/.config/yolo/work/pi/
# Should include copies: settings.json, AGENTS.md, APPEND_SYSTEM.md, cq-agents,
# prompts, skills, extensions, mcp.json
```

If the copies are missing, recreate the profile directory and restart pi:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.config/yolo/work/pi
yolo --profile work pi login
```

### Sandbox permission denied on a file I need

The sandbox grants read-write access only to the working directory, `~/.cache`, cq's XDG state root, and (for named profiles) the active profile's directories. If you need access to another path:

1. Copy or symlink it into your working directory.
2. Or, run the agent without a profile (`yolo claude`) to use the default configuration (but lose profile isolation).
3. Or, use the `/environment` skill to temporarily break out of the sandbox and fetch the file.
